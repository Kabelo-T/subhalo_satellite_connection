# subhalo_satellite_connection
This code accompanies the paper Modeling the Connection Between Subhalos and Satellites in Milky Way-Like Systems (arxiv.org/abs/1809.05542). It implements the model described in the paper, which maps subhalos in dark matter-only zoom-in simulations of MW-mass halos to their corresponding satellite galaxies.
