This code accompanies the following papers:

Milky Way Satellite Census -- II. Galaxy-Halo Connection Constraints Including the Impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03303)

Modeling the Connection Between Subhalos and Satellites in Milky Way-Like Systems (arxiv.org/abs/1809.05542). 

It implements the models described in these papers, which map subhalos in dark matter-only zoom-in simulations of MW-mass halos to their corresponding satellite galaxies.

It also contains tools for calculating the orbits of "orphan" (disrupted) subhalos in dark matter-only simulations, which are used in the analyses.
